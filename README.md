## 👋 Hi, I’m Sanaz, welcome to my GitHub

- 📖 I'm a PhD student at the Oxford Protein Informatics Group (OPIG)
- 🌱 I’m interested in the application of deep learning for _de novo_ drug design. Specifically, structure based drug design.
-  💊 On the weekends, I'm also a pharmacist
- 💞️ I’m always looking to learn more so if you have any projects you think I might be interested in, let me know!
